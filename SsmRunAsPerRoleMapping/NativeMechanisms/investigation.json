  "question": "Can per-role Linux identity mapping in SSM Session Manager be achieved using native AWS mechanisms -- such as SSM session document preferences, STS session tags from permission sets, SSM StartSession condition keys, or permission set inline policies -- without custom infrastructure like Lambda?",
  "context": "The current PoC uses Entra ID extensionAttribute1 mapped through SCIM to IdC ABAC SSMSessionRunAs tags. This achieves per-user Linux identity mapping via SSM-SessionManagerRunShell with runAsEnabled=true. The SSMSessionRunAs tag is set on the IdC user object, so if alice has SSMSessionRunAs=admin, she gets 'admin' regardless of which permission set she selects. The question is whether there is a native way to make the Linux session user depend on the permission set chosen, not just the user's identity.",

    ],
    "notes": "No native AWS mechanism allows the SSMSessionRunAs value to vary by permission set for the same user. The tag is always resolved from the user's identity (IdC user attributes or IAM entity tags), never from the permission set or assumed role."
  },
  "key_findings": [
    "SSM Session Manager resolves the RunAs user through a fixed precedence chain: first it checks whether the calling IAM principal has an SSMSessionRunAs tag (as an IAM user tag, role tag, or STS session tag via aws:PrincipalTag); if not found, it falls back to the runAsDefaultUser value in the account's Session Manager preferences document (SSM-SessionManagerRunShell). There is no mechanism to inject a per-permission-set value into this chain.",
    "IAM Identity Center ABAC attributes are per-user, not per-permission-set. When a user assumes any permission set, IdC sends the same set of ABAC attribute values (configured in 'Attributes for access control') as STS session tags. The permission set selection does not influence which attribute values are sent. This means SSMSessionRunAs will always resolve to the same value for a given user regardless of which permission set they choose.",
    "AWSReservedSSO_ roles created by IAM Identity Center are protected resources. AWS denies IAM TagRole operations on these roles with the error 'Cannot perform the operation on the protected role'. This prevents directly tagging each permission set's role with a different SSMSessionRunAs value in member accounts.",
    "The SSM session document schema supports parameterization of runAsDefaultUser using {{parameterName}} template syntax. However, the StartSession API's Parameters map is designed for document-defined parameters in the properties section (e.g., portNumber for port forwarding), and there is no documented support for passing runAsDefaultUser as a runtime parameter override through the StartSession API.",
    "Different permission sets can be restricted to different SSM session documents via IAM policy Resource elements (e.g., permission set A only allows arn:aws:ssm:region:account:document/SSMRunAs-Admin-Session). However, when the SSMSessionRunAs tag is present on the calling principal, SSM uses the tag value to determine the RunAs user, overriding the runAsDefaultUser in the document. This means document-level RunAs settings are subordinate to the tag.",
    "The ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck condition key is a boolean that controls whether SSM validates the caller's permission to use the specified session document. It does not select which document to use or influence RunAs user resolution. It serves as a gate for document access enforcement, not a mechanism for per-role identity mapping.",
    "For non-IdC federation (direct SAML to IAM), the IdP can theoretically include different SSMSessionRunAs values in the SAML assertion based on which role ARN the user selects. However, IAM Identity Center abstracts this -- the IdC-to-AWS SAML flow is not directly configurable by the customer, and the same ABAC attributes are always sent regardless of permission set selection.",
    "Permission set inline policies can reference aws:PrincipalTag/SSMSessionRunAs in IAM Condition blocks to allow or deny ssm:StartSession based on the tag value. This enables defense-in-depth (e.g., the 'Developer' permission set can deny StartSession unless SSMSessionRunAs matches 'developer'). But the inline policy cannot set or modify the tag value -- it can only gate access based on an already-existing tag.",
    "An alternative native approach considered was maintaining separate SSM preference documents per role (e.g., SSMRunAs-Admin-Session with runAsDefaultUser=admin) and restricting each permission set's IAM policy to only allow that specific document. This would work only if the SSMSessionRunAs tag is absent from the principal, because the tag overrides the document's runAsDefaultUser. Removing the ABAC SSMSessionRunAs attribute entirely and relying solely on per-document RunAs settings combined with per-permission-set IAM restrictions is a theoretically viable but fragile approach.",
    "The per-document-per-permission-set approach (finding above) has a critical limitation: if a user starts a session without specifying --document-name, SSM falls back to SSM-SessionManagerRunShell. The ssm:SessionDocumentAccessCheck condition key can enforce that a document must be specified, but the user experience degrades because every session start requires an explicit --document-name flag or a wrapper script."

  "tensions": [
    "Per-user vs. per-role identity: IdC ABAC attributes are fundamentally per-user (set on the identity store user object). SSM's RunAs tag resolution also treats the tag as a property of the calling principal. There is no native seam where the permission set identity can influence the RunAs value without custom infrastructure.",
    "Tag override vs. document settings: When the SSMSessionRunAs tag is present, it overrides the runAsDefaultUser in any session document. This means the per-document-per-permission-set approach only works if the ABAC SSMSessionRunAs attribute is removed entirely, sacrificing the per-user override capability.",
    "Protected roles vs. direct tagging: AWSReservedSSO_ roles cannot be tagged, closing off the most obvious native approach (tag each permission set's role with a different SSMSessionRunAs value). This protection exists for good reason (preventing privilege escalation via role modification), but it blocks a legitimate use case.",
    "User experience vs. document enforcement: Requiring users to always specify --document-name to select the correct RunAs document degrades usability compared to transparent ABAC tag resolution. Wrapper scripts or CLI aliases can compensate, but these are not native AWS mechanisms.",
    "Defense-in-depth vs. actual enforcement: Permission set inline policies can deny SSM sessions unless the SSMSessionRunAs tag matches an expected value, but they cannot set the tag. This provides guardrails but not the actual per-role mapping -- the mapping must still come from somewhere else."
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Could a future AWS feature allow IdC ABAC attributes to be scoped per-permission-set rather than per-user? This would natively solve the per-role RunAs mapping problem. No public roadmap item or feature request response was found.",
    "Does the SSM StartSession API actually reject runAsDefaultUser if passed in the Parameters map, or does it silently ignore it? The documentation does not list supported parameter keys for Standard_Stream session type documents. Testing would be needed to confirm.",
    "If the SSMSessionRunAs ABAC attribute is removed and per-document RunAs is used instead, does the session still log the correct originating user identity in CloudTrail and Session Manager audit logs?",
    "Can the AWS CLI session-manager-plugin be configured with a default --document-name per profile, avoiding the need for users to specify it manually on every session start?",
    "For non-IdC SAML federation (direct to IAM), could an IdP be configured to include different SSMSessionRunAs values in SAML assertions based on the selected role ARN? This would be a native-adjacent approach but is outside the IdC model."
