# Investigation: SSM RunAs Sync Pipeline — Entra ID, IAM Identity Center, and LZA

**Date:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Complete

## Full Pipeline: Ownership and Sync Mechanism by Layer

| Layer | What It Controls | LZA-Managed? | Correct Tool / Mechanism | Key Constraint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Entra ID attribute sourcing for SSMSessionRunAs | Which attribute value is emitted per user in the SAML assertion or synced via SCIM | No | Entra ID user object (custom extension attribute or sAMAccountName) + SCIM sync to IdC identity store | Must be a per-user attribute — group-derived values cause multi-group collision and hard rejection by IdC ABAC |
| IAM Identity Center ABAC attribute configuration | Mapping of user-profile attributes to IAM session tags (aws:PrincipalTag) via InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration | No — confirmed gap | Console, aws ssoadmin CLI, CloudFormation AWS::SSO::InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration, or Terraform aws_ssoadmin_instance_access_control_attributes | LZA identityCenter block has no key for this resource; it must be owned by a supplemental IaC tool or the IdC console |
| Permission sets and assignments | Which IAM policies users receive; which accounts they can access | Yes — via identityCenter block in iam-config.yaml | LZA identityCenterPermissionSets and identityCenterAssignments | OU-scoped assignments cover direct children only (GitHub #220); management account assignment failures in v1.7.0+ (GitHub #215, #496) |
| SSM-SessionManagerRunShell per account | runAsEnabled and runAsDefaultUser in each member account's SSM preferences document | Partially — LZA preserves but does not write RunAs fields | cloudFormationStackSets in customizations-config.yaml, targeting Root OU with auto-deployment enabled, carrying a Lambda custom resource that calls ssm:UpdateDocument | LZA ssmAutomation shares document references only — it does not deploy a local copy; SSM-SessionManagerRunShell must be locally owned per account |
| SCP guardrail for SSM document immutability | Prevents member account admins from modifying SSM-SessionManagerRunShell after deployment | No — must be added separately | SCP denying ssm:UpdateDocument, ssm:CreateDocument, ssm:DeleteDocument on SSM-SessionManagerRunShell resource, applied at Root OU or relevant member OUs | SCP must exempt the StackSet service role and LZA pipeline role or the enforcement mechanism will block its own writes |

> Two tools are required for this pipeline: LZA (for permission sets and assignments) and a supplemental IaC tool or the IdC console (for ABAC attribute configuration). LZA alone cannot configure the full pipeline.

## Question

> How do organizations using AWS Landing Zone Accelerator, IAM Identity Center federated via Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD, and SSM Session Manager resolve the SSMSessionRunAs multi-group conflict — and how can the full pipeline (Entra ID attribute sourcing, IAM Identity Center ABAC configuration, and per-account SSM preferences) be kept in sync across a multi-account organization?

---

## Context

Organizations using AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) to manage a multi-account AWS organization, federated through IAM Identity Center (IdC) via Microsoft Entra ID / Azure AD, rely on SSM Session Manager for server access and require Session Manager's RunAs feature to authenticate engineers as named OS users on managed EC2 instances. The SSMSessionRunAs session tag — which drives that OS username selection — depends on a three-layer pipeline: attribute sourcing in Entra ID, ABAC mapping in IAM Identity Center, and per-account SSM preferences in each member account. Engineers encounter session failures or incorrect user assignment when any of these layers is misconfigured, when an engineer belongs to multiple Entra groups with conflicting attribute emissions, or when the SSM-SessionManagerRunShell document is absent or inconsistent across accounts. Understanding this pipeline requires looking at all three layers simultaneously because LZA manages some of them declaratively, leaves others entirely outside its scope, and preserves but does not enforce RunAs values in the SSM preferences document.

---

## Key Findings

- The root cause of SSMSessionRunAs multi-group conflict is a category error: when SSMSessionRunAs is sourced from Entra group membership, a user belonging to more than one qualifying group causes IAM Identity Center to hard-reject the SAML assertion — not silently select one value. This is a documented IdC ABAC behavior, not an STS-level issue. The fix is architectural, not operational.
- AWSReservedSSO_ roles — the IAM roles IdC creates per-permission-set per-account — cannot be tagged by customers. AWS blocks modification with an explicit 'protected role' error. The only path to pass SSMSessionRunAs for IdC-federated users is as a session tag via SAML assertion or ABAC user-profile attribute.
- The correct architecture sources SSMSessionRunAs from a per-user attribute in the Entra ID identity store — such as sAMAccountName or a custom extension attribute — synced to the IAM Identity Center identity store via SCIM. This value is constant across all of a user's permission-set selections and is immune to group-collision.
- LZA has no configuration surface for IAM Identity Center's Attributes for Access Control (InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration). This is the instance-level API that maps user-profile attributes to IAM session tags. It is a confirmed gap across all documented LZA versions (v1.3.x through v1.10.x+) and must be managed via the IdC console, the aws ssoadmin CLI, CloudFormation AWS::SSO::InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration, or Terraform aws_ssoadmin_instance_access_control_attributes.
- LZA explicitly preserves existing runAsEnabled and runAsDefaultUser values when it updates SSM-SessionManagerRunShell (e.g., for logging changes) — it does not overwrite them. This prevents pipeline regression but also means LZA can never be the enforcement agent for RunAs values. RunAs content must be written by a separate mechanism.
- The StackSet + Lambda pattern — as demonstrated by the AWS Security Blog post 'How to automate Session Manager preferences across your organization' (November 2025) and its companion sample (aws-samples/sample-how-to-automate-session-manager-preferences) — is the correct approach for org-wide SSM RunAs configuration. However, LZA's cloudFormationStackSets in customizations-config.yaml creates SELF_MANAGED StackSets only: the CloudFormationStackSetConfig interface exposes no permissionModel or autoDeployment property (GitHub issues #810 and #666 are open feature requests as of v1.14.x). To use SERVICE_MANAGED permissions — required for auto-deployment to new accounts via Organizations lifecycle events — the StackSet must be deployed outside LZA's customizations pipeline, via a standalone CloudFormation template, Terraform, or a separate automation layer.
- LZA's ssmAutomation section in security-config.yaml creates SSM documents in the Audit account and shares them via ModifyDocumentPermission. This is a document-sharing mechanism, not deployment: the document remains Audit-account-owned and is referenced — not copied — by member accounts. SSM-SessionManagerRunShell must be locally owned per account and cannot be satisfied by a cross-account share.
- CloudFormation SERVICE_MANAGED StackSets with auto-deployment enabled do trigger stack instance creation from Organizations lifecycle events when an account joins a targeted OU — this is the correct mechanism for closing the new-account gap without requiring a pipeline run. However, this capability is NOT available through LZA's cloudFormationStackSets in customizations-config.yaml, which creates SELF_MANAGED StackSets only (the CloudFormationStackSetConfig interface has no permissionModel or autoDeployment property; GitHub issues #810 and #666 are open feature requests as of v1.14.x). The auto-deployment pattern therefore requires the StackSet to be deployed outside LZA's customizations pipeline.
- An SCP denying ssm:UpdateDocument, ssm:CreateDocument, and ssm:DeleteDocument on the SSM-SessionManagerRunShell resource must be applied org-wide to prevent member account administrators from modifying the preferences document after the StackSet configures it. The SCP must explicitly exempt the StackSet service role (AWSServiceRoleForCloudFormationStackSetsOrgAdmin) and the LZA pipeline role, or the enforcement mechanism will block its own writes.
- SCIM-synchronized attributes take precedence over SAML assertion values for the same attribute key in IdC ABAC evaluation — confirmed by AWS documentation. Console-configured attributes (via InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration) also override SAML assertion values. The relative ordering between console-configured attributes and SCIM-synchronized attributes when both specify the same key is not documented by AWS and cannot be determined from documentation alone.
- OU-scoped identityCenterAssignments in LZA apply only to direct child accounts of the specified OU — nested child OUs are silently excluded (GitHub issue #220). Management account assignments have a documented history of failure in LZA v1.7.0 and later (GitHub issues #215 and #496); operators must verify current behavior against their deployed LZA version.
- Active IAM role sessions are not immediately invalidated when LZA updates a permission set and calls ProvisionPermissionSet. Temporary credentials issued before a policy change remain valid until the session duration on the permission set expires — up to 12 hours. Updated permissions take effect only on new sessions.
- When organizations insist on group-derived RunAs values, the only viable IdP-side design is mutually exclusive Entra groups with claim transformation rules that emit a single, non-duplicated SSMSessionRunAs attribute — enforced by making groups disjoint at the application assignment level in Entra ID. This introduces operational overhead to maintain group disjointness as a provisioning invariant.

## Concepts & Entities

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| SSMSessionRunAs | An IAM session tag key recognized by AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. When present on the calling principal's session, Session Manager uses the tag's value as the OS username for the shell session on the managed node. Checked before the account-level default (runAsDefaultUser). Cannot be multi-valued. Must originate from a per-user ABAC attribute — not group membership — for IdC-federated users in multi-group scenarios. |
| RunAs (Session Manager) | A Session Manager feature that starts a session as a specified OS user rather than the default ssm-user account. Controlled via the SSMSessionRunAs principal tag (highest priority) or the runAsDefaultUser field in the SSM-SessionManagerRunShell account-level preferences document (fallback). Once enabled, failure to resolve a valid OS user causes session failure — there is no further fallback to ssm-user. |
| IAM Identity Center (IdC) | AWS service (formerly AWS SSO) that manages federated access to AWS accounts. Assigns users and groups to permission sets, which map to AWSReservedSSO_ IAM roles in member accounts. Supports ABAC via Attributes for Access Control, passing user attributes as session tags into each federated session. Hard-rejects SAML assertions containing duplicate or multi-valued attributes when ABAC is enabled. |
| ABAC (Attributes for Access Control) | The IAM Identity Center instance-level configuration that maps user-profile attributes to IAM session tags (aws:PrincipalTag) during federation. Configured via the CreateInstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration API. Not managed by LZA in any version — must be configured via the IdC console, aws ssoadmin CLI, CloudFormation AWS::SSO::InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration, or Terraform aws_ssoadmin_instance_access_control_attributes. |
| AWSReservedSSO_ role | An IAM role automatically created and managed by IAM Identity Center in each member account for each permission-set-to-account assignment. These roles are protected — customers cannot tag or modify them directly. The SSMSessionRunAs session tag must be passed via SAML or ABAC, not via a static role tag. |
| LZA customizations-config.yaml | The optional LZA configuration file for deploying resources not natively supported by LZA core. Supports cloudFormationStackSets (service-managed StackSets targeting OUs or Root) and cloudFormationStacks (per-named-account stacks). The CUSTOMIZATIONS pipeline stage processes this file after all security and operations stages complete. The correct LZA surface for delivering org-wide SSM-SessionManagerRunShell RunAs configuration. |
| cloudFormationStackSets (LZA) | An LZA customizations-config resource type that deploys a CloudFormation StackSet with service-managed permissions to target OUs or Root. Supports auto-deployment, which automatically creates stack instances in new member accounts when they join a target OU — without requiring an LZA pipeline run. The correct LZA-native mechanism for org-wide SSM-SessionManagerRunShell RunAs enforcement. |
| StackSet Auto-Deployment | A CloudFormation StackSets feature (service-managed permissions only) that automatically deploys a new stack instance to any account that joins a targeted OU or organization. Triggered by Organizations account-creation lifecycle events, not by the LZA pipeline. Closes the new-account gap between LZA's PREPARE and CUSTOMIZATIONS stages for StackSet-delivered configuration. |
| New-Account Gap | The temporal window between when LZA creates a new member account (Prepare stage, via Control Tower Account Factory) and when the CUSTOMIZATIONS stage completes and applies cloudFormationStackSets resources to that account. During this window, SSM-SessionManagerRunShell has default (unconfigured) RunAs settings. StackSet auto-deployment can close this gap via Organizations lifecycle events. |
| SCP Guardrail for SSM Document | A Service Control Policy attached to an OU or Root that denies ssm:UpdateDocument, ssm:CreateDocument, and ssm:DeleteDocument on the SSM-SessionManagerRunShell resource. Prevents member account administrators from modifying the preferences document after it has been set by the StackSet. Must exempt the StackSet service role and LZA pipeline role. Applies to all current and future member accounts in scope. |
| SCIM attribute precedence | AWS documents two confirmed precedence relationships in IdC ABAC evaluation: console-configured attributes (InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration) override SAML assertion values for the same key, and SCIM-synchronized attributes override SAML assertion values for the same key. The relative ordering between console-configured and SCIM-synchronized attributes when both specify the same key is not documented by AWS and requires empirical testing. |
| LZA identityCenter block | The top-level configuration object in iam-config.yaml that declares LZA's management of IAM Identity Center. Contains name, delegatedAdminAccount, identityCenterPermissionSets, and identityCenterAssignments. Has no sub-keys for ABAC attribute configuration, instance settings, relay state, MFA policy, or user/group creation. ABAC attribute configuration is the most operationally significant confirmed gap. |

## Tensions & Tradeoffs

- Using group membership to drive SSMSessionRunAs creates a permission-set-centric architecture that appears intuitive but causes a hard sign-in rejection the moment a user belongs to more than one qualifying group. IAM Identity Center enforces this at the ABAC layer — there is no soft failure, no fallback, and no AWS-native mechanism to auto-resolve the collision.
- LZA's preserve behavior for runAsEnabled and runAsDefaultUser protects customer-configured values from pipeline regression, but it is the same mechanism that prevents LZA from ever being the enforcement agent for RunAs values. The correct delivery path — a StackSet via customizations-config.yaml — operates in the CUSTOMIZATIONS stage and must co-exist with LZA's logging updates to the same SSM-SessionManagerRunShell document without conflict.
- LZA's identityCenter block provides strong declarative control over permission set content and assignment topology but has a confirmed gap at the ABAC layer. Organizations that want full IaC coverage must use a supplemental tool (Terraform, CloudFormation) specifically for InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration — creating a split-ownership model that requires coordination to prevent drift between the LZA config repo and the supplemental IaC stack.
- SCIM-synchronized attributes and console-configured ABAC attributes both override SAML assertion values in IdC ABAC evaluation. Teams running both SAML claim transformation rules and SCIM sync may silently suppress intentional per-session attribute overrides without a clear error — and cannot determine from AWS documentation which of those two sources (console-configured vs. SCIM) takes precedence when both specify the same key.
- OU-scoped assignment behavior (direct children only, not nested) creates a tension between configuration simplicity and accuracy. An operator who scopes an identityCenterAssignment to a parent OU may believe it covers all descendant accounts, but accounts in nested OUs are silently excluded until they are explicitly listed — a correctness gap that grows as the account hierarchy deepens.
- An SCP denying ssm:UpdateDocument on SSM-SessionManagerRunShell makes the document immutable for member account administrators, which is the desired guardrail posture. However, the LZA pipeline and the StackSet service role must be explicitly exempted from the SCP, or the enforcement mechanism will block its own writes. The SCP exception list becomes a dependency that must be maintained across LZA version upgrades and pipeline role name changes.
- The new-account gap (PREPARE stage to CUSTOMIZATIONS stage) can be closed by StackSet auto-deployment via Organizations lifecycle events — but this depends on the StackSet already existing in the organization. If the StackSet itself is delivered by LZA's CUSTOMIZATIONS stage and the initial pipeline run has not yet completed in a new region, the auto-deployment mechanism does not yet exist to trigger.

## Open Questions

- What is the confirmed precedence between console-configured ABAC attributes (InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration) and SCIM-synchronized attributes when both specify the same key for a given user in IAM Identity Center? AWS documentation confirms each independently overrides SAML assertions but does not document their relative ordering. Teams using both cannot predict the effective SSMSessionRunAs value from documentation alone.
- When SCIM sync from Entra ID to IAM Identity Center is active and a user's custom extension attribute is null or empty, does IdC pass an empty SSMSessionRunAs session tag (causing session failure if RunAs is enabled) or omit the tag entirely (falling back to the account-level default in SSM-SessionManagerRunShell)?
- Does LZA's preserve behavior for runAsEnabled and runAsDefaultUser apply when LZA creates SSM-SessionManagerRunShell for the first time in a new account (where the document does not yet exist), or only when updating an existing document? If LZA creates the document with default values before the StackSet runs, what is the resulting document version state?
- What is the current behavior of LZA management account assignments in the latest release (v1.14.x)? GitHub issues #215 and #496 indicate failures introduced in v1.7.0 were partially addressed, but it is unclear whether the fix is complete for all partition types.
- Does the SCP deny pattern for ssm:UpdateDocument on SSM-SessionManagerRunShell need to explicitly exempt AWSServiceRoleForCloudFormationStackSetsOrgAdmin, or does StackSet service-managed deployment assume a member-account role that falls outside SCP scope by default?
- Is there a CloudTrail event or identity-store API that exposes which ABAC attribute values a given user will receive at session initiation time — without actually starting a session — so that attribute misconfiguration can be detected proactively?
- For organizations that want per-permission-set OS users (e.g., dev-role maps to devuser, prod-role maps to produser), is the only supported path mutually exclusive Entra groups with disjoint claim transformation rules, or is there an IdC-native mechanism to override ABAC attributes per permission set without touching the Entra ID configuration?
