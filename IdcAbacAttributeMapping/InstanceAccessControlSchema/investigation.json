  "question": "What is the high-level configuration surface of InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration in IAM Identity Center for mapping a per-user SCIM-synced attribute (e.g. sAMAccountName or a custom extension attribute) to the ssm:RunAsDefaultRunAs session tag \u2014 as exposed via AWS CDK (TypeScript), CloudFormation, and AWS CLI?",
  "context": "IAM Identity Center's Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) feature allows user attributes stored in or synced to the IdC identity store to be passed as principal session tags into AWS. When a user assumes a permission set role, any configured attributes are emitted as aws:PrincipalTag/<Key> values on the STS session. SSM Session Manager's RunAs feature reads the SSMSessionRunAs session tag to determine which OS user to use for a session. Connecting these two surfaces \u2014 IdC ABAC attribute configuration and the SSM session tag \u2014 is the mechanism by which a SCIM-synced AD attribute (such as sAMAccountName or a custom extension attribute) can drive per-user OS login on managed instances without any per-user IAM configuration. The InstanceAccessControlAttributeConfiguration resource is the single control plane object that enables this pipeline.",

Key is the name the attribute will carry as a principal tag. Value.Source contains a ${path:...} expression for SCIM-synced identity store attributes or a literal identity source token. The Key value becomes the principal tag key verbatim on the STS session.",
    "For SCIM-synced identity store attributes (external IdP + Entra SCIM), Source uses ${path:...} expressions: e.g. ${path:userName}, ${path:enterprise.department}, ${path:enterprise.employeeNumber}. For AWS Managed Microsoft AD-connected instances, Source uses flat dollar-brace syntax: ${samaccountname}, ${userprincipalname}, ${mail}. These two syntaxes are distinct and not interchangeable. The correct path for a sAMAccountName-derived attribute depends on where Entra places it in its SCIM payload \u2014 not on the AD attribute name itself.",
